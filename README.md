sonar-build-breaker
===================
Add a setting on original sonar-build-breaker plugin : "Don't break the build" (true/false).

**Why not break the build while the goal of the plugin is to break the build ?!?**

When a company implements quality software on old projects for the first time, many alerts will raising and technical dept will certainly be monstrous !

The step is too large for the beginning and some time for ajustement is required.

This is why this setting has been added.

Obviously the best practice is to quickly come back on the default value : false.
